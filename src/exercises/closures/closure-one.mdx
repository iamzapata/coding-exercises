import scopechain from './scopechain.excalidraw.json'
import { Excalidraw } from '@components'
import { HEADING_LEVELS, HEADING_STYLES, Heading } from '@components/Heading'

## What is the output of the following code?

```js
var num = 4

function outer() {
  var num = 2

  function inner() {
    num++
    var num = 3
    console.log(num)
  }
  inner()
}

outer()
```

###

<Heading tag={HEADING_LEVELS.h2} textDecorationStyle={HEADING_STYLES.dotted}>
  Answer
</Heading>

The output is `3`.

### Explanation

There are are three concepts that play a role in this question. **Scope**, **Closures**, and
**Hoisting**.

#### Variable Scope

There are four scopes in JavaScript, Block Scope, Function Scope, Global Scope,
and Module Scope. In this excercise, we are interested in the Function Scope,
since `num` declarations are scoped to the wrappeing functions the appear in.

You can learn more about scopes in the [JavaScript Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)

#### Closures

Functions can access declarations that appear in an outer scope. When a function is called,
and it retains access to variables declared outside of it, this is known as a closure.
In this exercise we have three different declarations with the same name, `num`.

#### Hoisting

The first two `num` declarations don't have any effect
in the inner function. The third declaration shadows the two above.
It might seem as if each declaration is overriding the previous one, but
in reality each one lies in its own scope. The first one in the global scope,

<Excalidraw data={scopechain} name="closure-scope" />
